# Basic writing and formatting syntax
# 1- Headings: 
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

# 2- Styling text:

# 3- Quoting text:
## You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the command or Ctrl + e keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

# 4- Links: 
## You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.

## for example:
## This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
# 5- Lists:
## You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

## You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven spaces (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content First nested list item, you would need to indent the second nested list item by seven spaces.


# 6- Task lists:
## To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].
## If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \:

# 7- Mentioning people and teams :
## You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. For more information about notifications, see "About notifications.

# 8- Referencing external resources:
## If custom autolink references are configured for a repository, then references to external resources, like a JIRA issue or Zendesk ticket, convert into shortened links. To know which autolinks are available in your repository, contact someone with admin permissions to the repository. For more information, see "Configuring autolinks to reference external resources."


# 9- Content attachments :
## Some GitHub Apps provide information in GitHub for URLs that link to their registered domains. GitHub renders the information provided by the app under the URL in the body or comment of an issue or pull request.
