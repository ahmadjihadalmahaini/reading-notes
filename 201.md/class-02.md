# 1- HTML TEXT :
## HTML Text Formatting
## HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. HTML provides us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make text bold, italicized, or underlined. There are almost 14 options available that how text appears in HTML and XHTML.

## In HTML the formatting tags are divided into two categories:

## Physical tag: These tags are used to provide the visual appearance to the text.
## Logical tag: These tags are used to add some logical or semantic value to the text.

## 1) Bold Text
## HTML<b> and <strong> formatting elements

## The HTML <b> element is a physical tag which display text in bold font, without any logical importance. If you write anything within <b>............</b> element, is shown in bold letters.
# Superscript & Subscrip
# ![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/or0S3hMbGcQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

## A subscript or superscript is a character (such as a number or letter) that is set slightly below or above the normal line of type, respectively. It is usually smaller than the rest of the text. Subscripts appear at or below the baseline, while superscripts are above. Subscripts and superscripts are perhaps most often used in formulas, mathematical expressions, and specifications of chemical compounds and isotopes, but have many other uses as well.

## In professional typography, subscript and superscript characters are not simply ordinary characters reduced in size; to keep them visually consistent with the rest of the font, typeface designers make them slightly heavier (i.e. medium or bold typography) than a reduced-size character would be. The vertical distance that sub- or superscripted text is moved from the original baseline varies by typeface and by use.

## In typesetting, such types are traditionally called "superior" and "inferior" letters, figures, etc., or just "superiors" and "inferiors". In English, most nontechnical use of superiors is archaic.[1] Superior and inferior figures on the baseline are used for fractions and most other purposes, while lowered inferior figures are needed for chemical and mathematical subscripts
# White Space
## With many keyboard layouts, a whitespace character may be entered through the use of a spacebar. Horizontal whitespace may also be entered on many keyboards through the use of the Tab ↹ key, although the length of the space may vary. Vertical whitespace is a bit more varied as to how it is encoded, but the most obvious in typing is the ↵ Enter result which creates a 'newline' code sequence in applications programs. Older keyboards might instead say Return, abbreviating the typewriter keyboard meaning 'Carriage-Return' which generated an electromechanical return to the left stop (CR code in ASCII-hex &0D;) and a line feed or move to the next line (LF code in ASCII-hex &0A;); in some applications these were independently used to draw text cell based displays on monitors or for printing on tractor-guided printers—which might also contain reverse motions/positioning code sequences allowing text-based output devices to achieve more sophisticated output. Many early computer games used such codes to draw a screen (e.g. Kingdom of Kroz), and word processing software would use this to produce printed effects such as bold, underline, and strikeout.

## The term "whitespace" is based on the resulting appearance on ordinary paper. However they are coded inside an application, whitespace can be processed the same as any other character code and programs can do the proper action as defined for the context in which they occur.
# Author Details
## Adding Author Contact Information
## You might think the address element is for marking up a postal or street address, but it isn’t (except for one circumstance; see the first tip). In fact, there isn’t an HTML element explicitly designed for that purpose.

## Instead, address defines the contact information for the author, people, or organization responsible for either a part of a webpage (such as a news article, product review, or report) or a whole page (red-a.jpg and red-b.jpg). Which of those is true depends on where address appears. The first step describes each scenario.
# 2- Introducing CSS :
## CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements
## CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

# CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed ??
## display
## The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.

## Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types. The outer type sets an element's participation in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children. Some values of display are fully defined in their own individual specifications; for example the detail of what happens when display: flex is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model specification. See the table at the end of this document for all of the individual specifications.

# Using External CSS :

## External CSS
## With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

## Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
## An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

## The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

## Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks:

## "mystyle.css"
# Using Internal CSS :
## Internal CSS
## An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

## An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

## The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color: 
## CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes
## Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later.

## The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

## The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

## The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.
# CSS Selectors:
## In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.

## Use our CSS Selector Tester to demonstrate the different selectors.

# Different versions of CSS & Browser Quirks
## Quirks mode and strict mode
## Quirks mode and strict mode are the two ’modes’ modern browsers can use to interpret your CSS. This page gives a short overview of the reasons for and the differences between these two modes.

# 3- Basic JavaScript Instructions:

## JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.
## What is JavaScript?
## JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

## JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

## JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

## Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
## Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
## Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
## It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.

## The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!
#  Decision Making and Loops in C Programming

## A normal program is not a sequential execution of expressions or statements one after the other. It will have certain conditions to be checked or it will have certain number of iterations. When we check for certain conditions to execute further then it called as decision statements. If the condition in decision statements are true then one set of instructions are executed, if false then another set of instructions are executed. This kind of decision is cannot be done using conditional operator. That will be mainly used to return single line of action / result. When we have to perform series of operation, we use IF conditions.
