# 1- JavaScript:
# is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

# 2-Functions in JavaScript
# Just as in many other programming languages, in JavaScript too we can create functions.

# In JavaScript we use the function keyword for this followed by the name of the new function. Then the list of parameters in parentheses and then a block of expressions in curly braces. This is the body of the function.

# examples/js/function.html
# <script>
# function show() {
  # console.log('Hello World');

# console.log('before');
# show();
# console.log('after');
# </script>
# 3-  Function with parameters
# A much more interesting case is when we also provide parameters to the function. In the next example, in the function declaration we wrote that we are going to accept a single value and we want it to be assigned to the name variable. Then, we called the function and passed a value to it. In every call we passed a different value.

# Inside the function the name variable holds the current value.

# This show the real power of functions.

# We can have one piece of code, that can be tested on it own, separately from the rest of the code, and then reused multiple times.
