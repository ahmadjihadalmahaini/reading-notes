# Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website
# When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code. Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface
# 2- HTML basics :
# HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way

# Anatomy of an HTML document
# That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article)
# <!DOCTYPE html>
# <html>
  # <head>
   # <meta charset="utf-8">
   # <title>My test page</title>
  # </head>
  # <body>
   # <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
 # </body>
# </html>
# Semantics
# In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

# CORS enabled image
# The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.
# CORS settings attributes
# Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.
